# Notes

### Intro

Smart contracts allow agreements to happen without a third party.

They are similar to normal contracts, except they are entirely written in code.

Smart contracts need real world data.

Oracles are devices that bring real world data into smart contracts.

How do you get decentralised real world data?

Hybrid smart contracts.

Smart contracts and hybrid smart contracts are used interchangeably.

Decentralised apps often use multiple smart contracts.

Blockchains and smart contract platforms are interchangeable.

### Lesson 0: Welcome to Blockchain
1. Decentralized
2. Transparent
3. Speed
4. Immutable
5. Remove counterparty risk
6. Allow for trust minimized agreements
7. Hybrid Smart Contracts combine on and off-chain

DAOs, live online in the smart contracts

Decentralized Autonomous Organization

Is eth still doing proof of work?

Sybil Resistance - users can't create multiple 'accounts' to gain greater power on the network.

PoW and PoS

Proof of Work (PoW)

its all about doing the computational work to solve the puzzle. 
nakamoto consensus, longest chain, with correct nounces from proof of work. 

Block confirmations. Proof of Work is a peice of the consensus consensus. 

Proof of work - miners
Proof of stake - validators

Miners can get paid from Transaction fees and any block reward.

Eth 2.0 will use PoS. 

PoS: nodes put up some stake as collateral, if they misbehave some of their stash is slashed.

How do we choose which node validates the next block?

How decentralised is enough?

sharding? a blockchain of blockchains

layer 1? Layer 1 is a base layer implementation of a blockchain.

Layer 2? Any application built on top of a layer 1.

Rollups - rollup transactions into layer 1? Send their transactions to the layer 1 to derive their security from the base layer.

Side chains - derive their own security through their own protocols. 

### Lesson 1: Welcome to Remix! Simple Storage
Deployed a smart contract

### Lesson 2: Storage Factory
Imported contracts
Used Inheritance
Deployed a contract from a contract.

### Lesson 3: Fund Me
Made a FundMe app that can take in funds, check that they are a certain minimum amount against real word data (usd to eth conversion rate) and then store the funds. The owner of the contract can then withdraw the funds.
